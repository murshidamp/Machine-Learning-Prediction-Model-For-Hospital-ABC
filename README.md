Introduction:

In the modern healthcare landscape, optimizing resource allocation while ensuring quality patient care is crucial for healthcare providers.
Hospital ABC aims to enhance its resource allocation and patient support services by understanding the factors influencing medical costs.
This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, health status, and other relevant information to predict medical costs for individual patients.
By accurately estimating medical expenses, Hospital ABC can allocate resources effectively and improve healthcare planning, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.

Problem Statement:

Hospital ABC faces the challenge of understanding the complex interplay of demographic factors, lifestyle choices, health status, insurance plan types, and other variables that influence medical costs.
Developing a predictive model to estimate these costs based on patient characteristics will enable Hospital ABC to optimize resource allocation and enhance patient support services.

Objectives:

-Explore the relationship between demographic factors, lifestyle-related information, health status, insurance plan type, and medical costs.

-Develop a predictive model to estimate medical costs for individual patients.

-Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics.

-Provide actionable insights for Hospital ABC to optimize resource allocation and enhance healthcare planning.
